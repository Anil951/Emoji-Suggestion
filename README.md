# Emoji Suggestion System

## Overview

The Emoji Suggestion System is an innovative tool that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to recommend emojis based on input text and emoji names or meanings. It preprocesses text by removing stop words, handling emojis, and forming word vectors. The system is capable of handling multilingual text through translation and transliteration. By computing cosine similarity between input embeddings and dataset values, it identifies similar emojis. Additionally, users can contribute to the emoji dataset by adding new emojis, enhancing the system's capabilities over time.


## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Remove stop words, handle emojis, and form word vectors.
- **Multilingual Support**: Translate and transliterate text in various languages.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Compute similarity between input embeddings and dataset values to suggest relevant emojis.
- **Dynamic Dataset**: Users can add new emojis to the dataset, expanding its capabilities.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive system for easily obtaining emoji suggestions based on input text.
